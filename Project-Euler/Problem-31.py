Problem 31:

In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are
eight coins in general circulation:

    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

    1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

             '10p': 10, '5p': 5, '2p': 2, '1p': 1}
reverse = {currency[k]:k for k in currency}

# There're two schemes
# The first one is straightforward but looks ugly and hard to be extended

    return count

# The second one uses dynamic programming. It's much more elegant
